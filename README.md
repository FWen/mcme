Simultaneous Consensus Maximization and Model Fitting

This is the code for reproducing the results of the MCME algorithm in the paper "Fei Wen, H. Wei, Y. Liu, P. Liu, Simultaneous Consensus Maximization and Model Fitting, 2020"

Some code from the code of Huu Le at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320707327demo_pami, 

Note that, some codes of Huu Le (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320707327demo_pami, see the 2d/src folder, including the RANSAC and EP methods and their dependency) and Alvaro Parra Bustos (http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2773482, see the 3d/common folder, including the ransac3dof and ransac6dof), which are used in our paper, are directly coped here to facilitate the ease of use for interested readers. They are copied here only for academic use purpose.
