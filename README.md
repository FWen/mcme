Simultaneous Consensus Maximization and Model Fitting

This is the code for reproducing the results of the MCME algorithm in the paper "Fei Wen, H. Wei, Y. Liu, P. Liu, Simultaneous Consensus Maximization and Model Fitting, 2020"

Note that, some codes of Huu Le (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320707327demo_pami, see the 2d/src folder, including the RANSAC and EP methods and their dependency), Alvaro Parra Bustos (https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/âˆ¼aparra/project/gore/sup.zip, see the 3d/common folder, including the ransac3dof and ransac6dof), and M. Schmidt (minFunc: unconstrained differentiable multivariate optimization in Matlab, http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc.html, 2005), which are used in our paper, are directly coped here to facilitate the ease of use for interested readers. They are copied here only for academic use purpose.
